21MAY  This has been an awesome learning expereince so far. 
1. Learned a bit about sockets and how UDP/TCP clients and servers interact under the hood.
2. Learned  many new types of syntax in Python.
3. Made my first useful tool, although it is kind of janky as of right now. I need to improve the formatting and clean up some of my errors. After running the tool, some commands lead to unexpected output.

1. Working on making a TCP Proxy server. Working along with the example in the book.

1. Got to spend a bit of time finishing up this proxy. Actually took a good bit of debugging to find some syntax errors I had. Super interesting stuff, as I am also progressing through my Python course through WGU concurrently, things I'm seeing in the code is starting to make more sense. 
2. Tested out the proxy on my VM and home network, it was pretty interesting to monitor the traffic through the proxy.
