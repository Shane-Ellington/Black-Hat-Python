21MAY  This has been an awesome learning expereince so far. 
1. Learned a bit about sockets and how UDP/TCP clients and servers interact under the hood.
2. Learned  many new types of syntax in Python.
3. Made my first useful tool, although it is kind of janky as of right now. I need to improve the formatting and clean up some of my errors. After running the tool, some commands lead to unexpected output.
